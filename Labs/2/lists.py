    Questions:
    
    1. if i wanted to insert 'tree' into the 3rd position in the object list, so that it does NOT replace any items,
        how do I do that?
    2. what is the difference between list.pop() and list.remove()
    3. print out the object list, sorted in reverse alphabetical order
