    Questions:
    
    01. if i wanted to insert 'tree' into the 3rd position in the object list, so that it does NOT replace any items,
        how do I do that?
    02. what is the difference between list.pop() and list.remove()
    03. print out the object list, sorted in reverse alphabetical order
