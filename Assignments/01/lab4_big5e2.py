Last week, you wrote a program where each question and answer was stored in a different variable.
This week, write a program that
      - stores the questions in a question_list.
      - prints the instructions
      - has a for loop that iterates over the list, each time through the loop
          - asks the question
          - saves the response to an answer_list
          - also updates their final_score
      - once the loop is done, the program should print out their final extroversion score using the same rules from
        last week
    - Don't forget to comment your code!
