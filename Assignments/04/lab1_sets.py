sets are like lists, except that you cant have duplicates.

"""
you can add items to a set with the .add() method. You add to a list (whereas you append to a list). Appending allows 
duplicates, adding does not. add some animals to the set. Try to add a duplicate and see what happens.

- copy()
- discard()
- remove()
- union()
- intersection()
- difference()
- difference_update()
- isdisjoint()
- issubset()
- issuperset()

use the copy method to create a second set. then add or discard/remove some items from the sets to make them different.
